# 2DStarve
![game demo](preview.gif)

2DStarve is a game **demo** me and a friend worked very hard on during the COVID-19 lockdown. [Past releases, FAQ, previews, map creation guide, and builds can be found here.](https://github.com/Desperationis/2DStarve-Releases) Based on Don't Starve, 2DStarve is a 2.5D multiplayer survival game based on Photon Bolt where you are meant to gather resources, craft items, and kill monsters with your friends. However, due to various factors, we were not able to implement most of the core functionality of the game. As of right now, here are the features that are implemented:

* Optimized for weak systems (computers faster than a phone but much slower than a gaming PC)
* Completely working chatbox
* Seamless multiplayer movement and synchronization
* Movement
* Death
* Basic attack system
* Game can either be configured to host a server or play as a client
* Fancy, very efficient lightning shader for campfires
* Day / night cycle
* Various mobs 
* [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)-based, dynamtically loaded maps

## Guide to Building
The most stable and sane version of the game is in version 2019.4.22f1. Later versions were found to have horrendous build and UI navigating times in the editor. In addition, a free server from [Photon Bolt](https://www.photonengine.com/bolt) must be obtained with a free account. **For now, I have left the app ID of the server from my account in there, so this is not strictly necessary, though don't rely on it being available in the future.** From there, navigate to the `MenuScene`, start the server, and enjoy our demo.
